## JW Player Support Team Reproduction Page

### Getting Started
***
If you want to download the source code, you can do so from this GitLab repository by clicking on the download button above.

However, if you use TextExpander, I would recommend copying and pasting the contents of [demo-uikit.html](https://gitlab.com/waxidiotic/jw-demo/blob/master/demo-uikit.html) into a new snippet. This way you can easily create a new reproduction page by expanding the snippet inside of a new document in your text editor of choice.

There is no need to download any of the JavaScript or CSS referenced by this reproduction page as they are all linked to using absolute URLs.

### Page Setup
***
By default, the page is setup in a way that is well-suited for escalations and bug reports.

If you would like to change this behavior to be more of a demo page, all you would need to do is comment and uncomment some lines of the code.

* Escalations/Bug Reports
	* Lines That Need to be Uncommented
		* 29
		* 43 thru 58
	* Lines That Need to be Commented
		* 30
		* 63 thru 65

* Demo Pages
	* Lines That Need to be Uncommented
		* 30
		* 63 thru 65
	* Lines That Need to be Commented
		* 29
		* 43 thru 58

To easily comment and uncomment code, most text editors support a keyboard shortcut. Just select whatever code you would like to be affected and press CMD+/ (forward-slash) on Mac or CTRL+/ on Windows.
